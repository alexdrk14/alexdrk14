## Hi there,ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alexander Shevtsov

As a Postdoctoral AI Research Scientist and Data Scientist, I am deeply passionate about machine learning, distributed computing, and working across all stages of the data lifecycle. With over 8 years of research and data analysis experience, I have collaborated with multiple institutes and research groups on a diverse range of open problems.

Additionally, I bring 3 years of hands-on experience as a Data Scientist, specializing in building, deploying, and monitoring AI models across various real-world scenarios.

My previous work includes the analysis and development of numerous AI models, including machine learning, federated learning, explainable AI, transformer models, and natural language processing. I have built these models from the ground up using Python, scikit-learn, and PyTorch, as well as leveraged well-known Hugging Face models, fine-tuning or training them for specific use cases.
